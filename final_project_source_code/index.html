        <h2>Product Vision</h2>
        

             <p>Our product vision is based on educating people on how to make drinks. This helps people save money by not having to rely on bars to make their drinks. 
             This will help bring people together as people will be able to share their own drink recipes in forums.The aim of this project would be to help more people explore the cocktail world, 
             their main goal is to be a one-stop shop for drink recipes, drinking-making tips, and instructions all while using common household ingredients. 
             It would save lots of people money and time from going to bars, while also expanding their horizons and exploring new flavors and drinks.</p>
