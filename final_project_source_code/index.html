    <h1>Drink Responsibly</h1>

        <h2>Product Vision</h2>
        

             <p>Our product vision is based on educating people on how to make drinks. This helps people save money by not having to rely on bars to make their drinks. 
             This will help bring people together as people will be able to share their own drink recipes in forums.</p> 

             <h2>Customer Description</h2>

                <p>Our customers would be adults 21 and above, people who want to get into making drinks but do not really know where to start. 
                People who would like to save money on drinks by making them at home instead of going to the bars. </p>
